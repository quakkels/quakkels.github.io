      <description>Lower Day Squats Pause at the bottom for one second. Work up to a 1RM over seven sets.
Warmup  135x10 185x5  Work  225x1 275x1 315x1 345x1 365x1 375x1 385x1  385lbs for one is certainly a paused PR. But, I think I could have gone heavier. It was right around 9 or 9.5 RPE. Given my recent track record of failing top sets it&amp;rsquo;s probably better that I didn&amp;rsquo;t make a heavier attempt.</description>

      <description>Upper Day Close Grip Bench Press Work up to 1RM over seven sets. Pause at the bottom for one second.
 45x10 95x5   185x1 195x1 205x1 215x1 225x1 235x1 245x1 (Pretty sure this is a PR)  245x1 definitely felt like a true 1RM. I changed my approach to these seven sets compared to last time. The warmups that I had been including are now separate sets so that the seven can be closer jumps.</description>

      <description>So I must&amp;rsquo;ve been under a rock for the last 21 months because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until this week that I learned that GitHub Pages now supports SSL certificates for custom domains. They&amp;rsquo;ve had SSL support since 2016 for sites using {user}.github.io domains. But it has also been available for custom domain sites (like this one) since May of 2018.
Before the feature was upgraded there were hacks to get around the custom domain limitation.</description>

      <description>No Plan Day Since I&amp;rsquo;m certainly going to change my program starting next week, I decide to stray from the HLM template that I&amp;rsquo;ve been following.
Today I focused on Farmer Walks and Cable rows. I spent some time rigging up a couple of pulleys to add to my Spud Inc pulley. So now I have a pulldown that is straight vertical, and I can rig it so I have a seated cable row as well.</description>

      <description>Heavy Day Squats are increasing slowly. Overhead press is increasing slowly. But deadlifts have regressed. I think one heavy set a week and one workout of SLDL 3x5 a week isn&amp;rsquo;t working. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if doing heavy squats in the same workout as heavy deadlifts is too taxing.
I might decide to go back a to 4 day split next week.

      <description>As a program ages and receives updates, more and more features are built. Logic is added and the code becomes increasingly more complicated to read and understand. So programmers invent recommended practices to manage the complexity and to preserve the maintainability of their code. The goal being to keep the cognitive load to minimum levels so the programmer can work efficiently.
One popular practice is to avoid nested code when possible.</description>

      <description>Using good function naming and composition will decrease the need for gratuitous comments and increase your code’s readability.
I&amp;rsquo;ve become convinced that comments are often worth avoiding. Comments aren&amp;rsquo;t subject to a compiler nor to an interpreter. Code may change and the corresponding comment often remains as it was. Except now the comment is misleading. This makes maintaining the code unnecessarily difficult.
Use Function Names to Document Code Consider this code that determines the &amp;ldquo;Day of the Programmer&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Clean Code by Robert C. Martin is one of my favorite programming texts. It has a chapter called Meaningful Names wherein principles for the clear and clean naming of code elements are explained.
When we write code we should be considering the programmer who follows us. Sometimes it may be ourselves who have not touched the code for months or years. The programmer working in previously written code will need to study it to try and recognize the intention and systems of the original author.</description>

      <description> Heavy Day Weights felt good today. Feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve accidentally timed my first workout back after Thanksgiving so that everything felt great.
Also, my shoulder didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me at all today. It&amp;rsquo;ll be tested in a couple days with bench.

The higher reps, closer grip, and pause made me feel like I was working at least a little bit. Didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go any heavier because I could definitely &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; the weight on my shoulder.

      <description>Today I started a new approach with Heavy/Light/Medium (HLM.)
Heavy Day Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x3 325x1 340lbs for 3 sets of 5  Squats were prescribed to be 5x5, but I changed it once the workout was underway because it was taking so long, and it felt heavy.
Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 155x1 157.5lbs for 3 sets of 5  Press was prescribed for 5x5. Decided to change it to 3x5 just like squat.</description>

Might attempt 485 tomorrow or Sunday.</description>

      <description>Deadlift Day Yay! Day two back on track.
Superset 1 Goal was to deadlift 405 for 5 sets of 3. But failed the third rep of the second set and had to back off a bit.
Deadlift: 3 at 405lbs, then 2 at 405lbs. Finished with 3 sets of 3 at 395lbs.

      <description>Overhead Press Day Getting back into the routine this week. Last week amounted to a full 7 days away from the gym. I was starting to feel a little run down anyway. The weights were feeling heavier than they should. So maybe the week off will do some good for my recovery.

      <description>Bench Day Conflicts in my schedule have caused me to miss a few days this week. I decided to skip ahead to bench day and modify it pretty heavily from what I usually do.
Bench: 230lbs 5x3
Barbell Row: 225lbs for 3. Then 245lbs for 2x3 (PR)
I am happy with the rowing. For the last several weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve used an axle bar. With an axle I end up being limited by grip.</description>

      <description> Overhead Press Day Switching it up! Changing up the Persistence program from the first time I ran it. Instead of an upper and lower superset each day, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have an upper body day with two upper body supersets. Lower body days will have two lower body supersets. This hopefully will be easier to recover from.

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that having limited high quality entertainment choices is better than having endless choices that are of questionable quality. So my household decided to end our Netflix subscription. This decision motivated me to build a private streaming media server for our home. Here is how I created a home media server with Plex and a home server tower.

      <description>Xamarin enables programmers to write native mobile applications for both Android and iOS using C# and free development tools like Visual Studio Community Edition. This means that if you&amp;rsquo;re invested in the .NET ecosystem and the C# language, you can write cross-platform mobile applications using technology that&amp;rsquo;s already familiar to you.
 A note on development for iOS: You will need a mac in order to build iOS versions of the app.</description>

      <description>Outfitting a home gym with a sled for drags and arm-over-arm pulls is simple. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment or gym memberships in order to train with a sled. You also don&amp;rsquo;t really need any tools or handyman skills to get started.
When I first wanted to add arm-over-arm pulls to work my cardio, grip, arms, and back, I looked around and found a few different options.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Django</title>

      <description>Django is a Python framework that I&amp;rsquo;ve written about before. I&amp;rsquo;ve compared Django to ASP.NET MVC. But, I didn&amp;rsquo;t go into much detail about how to actually use Django to create a data driven website. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ll cover now.
The goal for this &amp;lsquo;Getting Started&amp;rsquo; project is to get familiar with the basics of developing data driven web applications using Django, Models, Views, Templates, URLs, and Forms. By the end we&amp;rsquo;ll have a simple contact form that saves user submissions to the database, and displays that data to an administrator user.</description>

      <title>Configuring Vim When Using Git Bash on Windows</title>

      <description>Occasionally I become enamored with the idea of becoming a Vim expert, or at least a competent Vim user. I work primarily in Windows environments so, though the desire exists, there aren&amp;rsquo;t many good opportunities to build Vim habits. There is a Vim on Windows release available. This has a GUI interface and an installer executable. Though if you have Git for Windows installed, then you already have Vim available.</description>

      <title>Why I Prioritize Strength Training</title>

      <description>Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken up a new hobby; strength training. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve really grown to love. Though, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to articulate exactly why strength training has taken such a permanent position in my weekly routine.
When I was a sedentary person my quality of life decreased every year. Even when I was in my mid 20s I was not &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and frequent back and shoulder pain would frustrate me for weeks at a time.</description>

      <description>Raspberry Pis are great little computers. Wonderful for running hobby services. But, whenever I start a new RPi project, I dislike needing to dig out my spare HDMI monitor and USB keyboard. I don&amp;rsquo;t like having to take up room and connect all that hardware to just enable SSH and Wifi which renders all that equipment unnecessary.
Recently I learned how to flash a new micro SD card and configure it to connect to my Wifi network and enable SSH before even turning on the RPi for the first time.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve been in software planning meetings when an engineer addressed the team and claimed that we should use {insert technology here} because it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;Industry Standard.&amp;rdquo; I also can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve done the same thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone into my boss&amp;rsquo;s office and claimed that we should use a particular stack or technology because it&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;industry standard.&amp;rdquo;
This reasoning is attractive because on the surface it seems valid.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Take Frameworks for Granted</title>

      <description>Frameworks can help jump-start productivity on projects. But be careful. Relying too much on frameworks could also limit yourself in the long run.
Whenever the opportunity presents itself, programmers should carefully consider whether using a framework is beneficial. It may provide immediate benefits, but there should be no magic happening that isn&amp;rsquo;t understood by the programmer.
Years ago, I learned how to make websites with C#. I had help from many books, tutorials, and co-workers.</description>

      <description>I believe that programming is a craft. My goal is to continuously study this craft, and to always refine my thinking and my execution while practicing it. I have a decade of experience and even though I have come a long way since I started, there&amp;rsquo;s always something fresh to study that I can add to my toolbox.
Software development is a wonderful discipline that requires creativity, ingenuity, and logic.</description>

      <description>Please excuse the &amp;ldquo;click-baity&amp;rdquo; title. Sometimes I like to exaggerate.
Slack plays a significant role in my daily communication. My team at work has been using Slack as our primary mode of textual communication for over a year. It is also used by developer communities in my local area. At first, it felt a little clumsy. No more clumsy than a typical chat program. But, channels started to accumulate. The number of Direct Message feeds grew.</description>

      <description>The first movie I saw that really got me excited about computers was WarGames. The WOPR was an inanimate object that just sat there on screen. But, it was still a complete character all by itself. It reacted to the Matthew Broderick character&amp;rsquo;s commands and questions and became something more clever than just a boring piece of hardware. The fictional software running inside the WOPR and Broderick&amp;rsquo;s character&amp;rsquo;s ability to interface with it created a story that was incredibly mystical and exciting.</description>

      <description>Programmers are often creators. Being a creator takes vision. Vision to see the destination, and vision to see the course. The destination could be learning a new language or technology stack. The destination could be a product to be released to customers. It could be something done for personal edification. The course is determined by taking that larger goal and breaking it down to manageable steps.
The trick for successfully creating something, is to maintain that vision.</description>

      <description>In the back of my mind I&amp;rsquo;ve always been intrigued by writing an application that can retrieve web pages over HTTP. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly simple thing to do. We have a myriad of web browsers that do it for us. But there is just something about writing an application that operates independently of a browser and reaches out to touch the internet that I find fun and intriguing. So let&amp;rsquo;s do it&amp;hellip; in Python.</description>

      <description>Your favorite website is asking you for your username and password.
Username? Password? Sure, you&amp;rsquo;ve got those. [You enter your username] then [you enter your password] then [you press enter] then boom, you&amp;rsquo;re logged into the website.
What actually just happened? Well, assuming that you entered correct login credentials, you can now access whatever members only area that site offers to those credentials. But before that, in the split seconds after you clicked login and before you saw your profile, the website had to verify that the credentials you entered were correct.</description>

      <description>I think you could say I have an average number of video game discs. It&amp;rsquo;s not a huge number of games, but it is enough that it can be difficult to find a particular game if they&amp;rsquo;re not organized in a predictable way.
Enter insertion sort. Insertion sort is in the same family as the bubble sort in that its worst case complexity is O(n2). But in practice, it is usually a faster sort.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an unordered list of numbers and you wanted to put them in order from lowest to highest value. How would you do that? You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that you would just look at all the numbers, find the lowest number and put it at the beginning of your list. Then you would find the next largest number and put it in the second spot in the list, and so on until you&amp;rsquo;ve ordered the entire list of numbers.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re a long way from my bread and butter. My goto technologies for database interaction are .NET, C# and Entity Framework CodeFirst with SQL Server 2005&amp;frasl;2008.</description>

      <description>The MVC pattern is widely used in web development today. Regardless of whether you develop in C#, PHP, Python, Java, JavaScript, or Ruby, you won’t have any trouble finding a popular MVC pattern for your language of choice.
Being primarily a C# developer, I’ve been using ASP.NET MVC since version 1. It’s a great framework. It can be very good at getting a project off the ground quickly, especially when coupled with a good ORM such as NHibernate, or Entity Framework.</description>
