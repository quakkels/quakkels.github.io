<p>I bought my first deer rifle in 2021. Friends recommended I try Savage, and I found one. It was a Savage Axis in 30-06 for right around $350 bucks at Cabela&rsquo;s. I felt so lucky because, if you remember, guns were in high demand in 2021. Unfortunately, that lucky feeling was shortly followed by astonishment when I saw all the .308 on the shelves, with nary a box of 30-06 anywhere. Oh well.</p>
<p>I eventually scrounged up some 30-06 online, and I was off to the range to zero the thing. I&rsquo;d open the bolt, drop a round in, close the bolt, take aim, fire, adjust, and repeat. Eventually I dialed it in and was able to hit the target with only about an inch of play. I was happy.</p>
<p>But, I did not realize that somewhere along the line my rifle was assembled incorrectly. I&rsquo;m probably at fault for this, but it&rsquo;s such an easy mistake to make, I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past anyone. You can only really detect the mistake if you&rsquo;re actually working the bolt to feed rounds from the magazine.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I could not get my Savage Axis rifle to feed reliably.</p>
<p>At first I assumed I was working the action wrong. I would practice cycling the bolt very deliberately, but it was no use. I tried different dummy rounds, because maybe the rounds themselves were the issue. Nope. They weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I was getting disappointed enough to consider selling the gun. But then, I finally found the simple fix I was looking for.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-fixed-my-savage-axis-feeding-problem">How I Fixed My Savage Axis Feeding Problem</h2>
<p>The very first thing to do is a basic safety check. Make sure the rifle is unloaded and the chamber is clear. Make sure there&rsquo;s no ammunition in the room with you.</p>
<p>Next, take out the bolt.</p>
<ol>
<li>Push the bolt all the way forward</li>
<li>Set the safety to the &ldquo;fire&rdquo; position</li>
<li>Open the bolt and pull it all the way back</li>
<li>Press on the thumb sear (on the right-hand side of the gun) and pull the trigger at the same time</li>
<li>Pull the bolt back again to remove it completely</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/savage_axis_remove_bolt.png" alt="Photo showing the Savage Axis bolt being removed."></p>
<p>Once the bolt is out, take a close look at it. There&rsquo;s a piece on the end that can spin. This spinny piece was the cause for my feeding problems. It needs to be in the correct position.</p>
<p>Spin the spin-able piece until it matches the picture.</p>
<p><img src="/images/savage_axis_bolt.png" alt="A photo of a correctly aligned Savage Axis bolt, and of an incorrectly aligned bolt."></p>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s aligned correctly you can reinstall the bolt.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the thumb sear is still pressed and the trigger is pulled</li>
<li>Insert the bolt and push completely forward</li>
<li>Close the bolt</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if you experienced the same feeding issues as me, then you should be able to cycle through an entire magazine of dummy rounds with no feeding issues.</p>
