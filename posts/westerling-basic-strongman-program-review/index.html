<p>This is my review of Basic Strongman. Basic Strongman is a <a href="http://www.mikewesterling.com/strongman-ebook.html">program by Mike Westerling</a> that I spent the last 12 weeks running. It&rsquo;s a 3-day-a-week program for general strength and the sport of Strongman.</p>

<h2 id="my-lifting-history">My Lifting History</h2>

<p>First a little about me to give you some context for this review. I&rsquo;m 35 and not particularly athletic. Four years ago I started taking strength training seriously. I had gone to commercial gyms off and on for a couple years before building a home gym. The first true strength program I tried was Stronglifts5x5. That&rsquo;s when I realized how much fun it was to train for strength. It became my fitness priority. I cycled through 5/3/1, 3x5, and 5x5 programs sticking primarily to Wendler and Rippetoe ideologies. Over that time I had successes and some setbacks. I had three fairly significant breaks from lifting. They were when my son was born, when I needed a surgery, and when I had pretty bad hip pain that kept me from squatting and deadlifting normally until I figured out how to get rid of the pain with bands and hip stability movements. I competed in Strongman once as a Novice Class competitor, and I intend to compete again.</p>

<p>In January of this year I found a Strongman competition scheduled for April 11th. I decided to compete in it. Based on positive opinions found on r/Strongman I settled on using Basic Strongman from Mike Westerling&rsquo;s e-book, Built By Mike, to prepare for the competition. Ultimately I didn&rsquo;t compete due to the pandemic, but I still had success on the program.</p>

<h2 id="basic-strongman-s-biggest-differences">Basic Strongman&rsquo;s Biggest Differences</h2>

<p>Compared to all the other programs I&rsquo;ve tried, Basic Strongman easily requires the most specialized equipment. A yoke, farmers handles, log, axle, tire, and stones aren&rsquo;t always easy to find. Then there&rsquo;s also the more ubiquitous barbell, rack, bench, and deadlift blocks. The variety is a strength of this program because it&rsquo;s designed to get you ready for just about anything a Strongman contest can throw your way.</p>

<p>Basic Strongman is definitely specific to the sport of Strongman. It takes into consideration the unique training stresses a competitor experiences. It&rsquo;s way more than just a powerlifting program with an events day stapled to the end of the week. It identifies where there&rsquo;s overlap between movements and it accounts for them so that you don&rsquo;t get run down.</p>

<p>The biggest way it keeps lifters fresh is by structuring everything in a bi-weekly schedule. One week you&rsquo;ll be doing a back squat and deadlifting from the floor. The next week you&rsquo;ll be front squatting and deadlifting from blocks. One week you&rsquo;ll be training farmers walk and the next you&rsquo;ll be training yoke. This structure is sustainable and I found this doesn&rsquo;t just keep you fresh physically, it also keeps the program from getting boring.</p>

<p>The first 6 weeks of the program also make great use of paused movement variations. I hadn&rsquo;t ever trained paused squat or paused bench, but I found they really helped my stability and strength in the bottom of the movement. When the second half of the program started I was eager to see what I could lift without pauses.</p>

<p>Finally, every single day is a max effort day. You&rsquo;ll be working up over several sets to five rep maxes, three, two, and single maximum lifts. This seemed to go against the advice I&rsquo;ve seen sprinkled around online, which has the general sentiment: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t constantly test your personal records.&rdquo; But, on this program that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re trying to do. And it&rsquo;s a ton of fun. I frequently set multiple PRs for reps in a single day. And I kept beating my PRs as the program went on.</p>

<h2 id="modifications">Modifications</h2>

<p>I did make some modifications to the program. I substituted a few things because of equipment limitations or competition considerations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Deficit deadlifts instead of deadlifts.</li>
<li>Sandbags for loading instead of stones.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have a tire, so I eventually substituted sled pushes for tire flips.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also did not pull the deficit deadlifts using touch&rsquo;n&rsquo;go for the first six weeks. I was using mostly bumper plates and I was brand new to pulling from a deficit. With my inexperience and the bouncing bar I was worried about hurting myself. So I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<h2 id="blunders">Blunders</h2>

<p>I made other modifications that I consider blunders. I didn&rsquo;t follow day three very well at all. I missed some days and I decided I didn&rsquo;t want to train yoke, and I was lazy and didn&rsquo;t make the effort to figure out my sled setup. By the end I really regretted these decisions and I eventually did train yoke and sled pushes, but I had missed out on a lot of progress if I had just done those things from the beginning.</p>

<p>It also took a little while to get the hang of picking my weights for each incrementally heavier set. Eventually I got the feel of it. Mike recommends favoring smaller PRs rather than ambitious ones.</p>

<p>Despite these blunders I still made progress.</p>

<p>* Hadn&rsquo;t trained the lift in over six months before starting this program.<br>
** Didn&rsquo;t have a max previous to running this program.</p>

<p>Even though I substituted deadlifting from the floor with a deficit deadlift, I still got a +10 pound <a href="/training_log/0069/">deadlift PR</a>.</p>

<p>To see each workout I did you can look at my <a href="/training_log/">training log</a>. I started <a href="/training_log/0034/">January 20th</a> and ended <a href="/training_log/0067/">April 13th</a>.</p>

<h2 id="surprises">Surprises</h2>

<ol>
<li>I was able to make progress without gaining weight.</li>
<li>The bi-weekly structure got me stronger.<br />
Until now I avoided this program because I thought for sure it wouldn&rsquo;t work. My past experience indicated that to make progress I had to perform each of the big four lifts at least twice a week and eat protein like it was my job. Performing a lift only <strong>once</strong> on a <strong>bi-weekly</strong> schedule sounded crazy, but it worked very well.</li>
<li>No &lsquo;run down&rsquo; feeling at the end of 12 weeks.</li>
<li>Constantly trying to get PRs seems to work.</li>
<li>My deadlift improved even though I didn&rsquo;t train a regular deadlift from the floor.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This program was a ton of fun. I got stronger. I did not feel rundown at the end. This program likely could be run repeatedly for a long time. Probably not a good program for beginners because you pick your own weight jumps, you need to know how to strain, and you need to either have access to a fair amount of equipment or know how to make sensible substitutions. Overall, this was great and I recommend following the program as Mike Westerling wrote it.</p>
