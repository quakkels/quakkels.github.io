<p>Outfitting a home gym with a sled for drags and arm-over-arm pulls is simple. You don&rsquo;t need to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment or gym memberships in order to train with a sled. You also don&rsquo;t really need any tools or handyman skills to get started.</p>
<p>When I first wanted to add arm-over-arm pulls to work my cardio, grip, arms, and back, I looked around and found a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.roguefitness.com/conditioning/strength-equipment/sleds">few different options</a>. And some of them were rather economical. However, most are still priced near a hundred dollars and they don&rsquo;t include a rope nor a strap long enough for arm-over-arm pulls, which I&rsquo;d have to purchase separately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simpler and cheaper alternative to those econo sleds. It can be found at the local hardware store.</p>
<p>This tow strap cost me just about ten dollars.</p>
<p><img src="/images/new_tow_strap.png" alt="20&rsquo; Tow Strap"></p>
<p>When I combine it with a few of my bumper plates, it does exactly what I need. Ta-da! A &ldquo;sled&rdquo; for my home gym.</p>
<p><img src="/images/first_sled_experiment.png" alt="Arm-over-arm pull with a 20&rsquo; tow strap"></p>
<p>This first experiment was awesome. It was easy to set up and it worked. Though, I did I noticed wear on the strap underneath the bumper plates. At first I thought it was no big deal. But if I had to replace the fraying strap a few times my costs would eventually be comparable with if I had bought an actual post style sled.</p>
<p>So to address the wear on the strap, I made a sheath using a an easily replaceable resource I frequently have lying around; a piece of cardboard.</p>
<p><img src="/images/sled_experiment_with_cardboard_sheeth.png" alt="A more resilient sled using a 20&rsquo; tow strap"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy with this setup. The cardboard works well on my reasonably smooth basement floor. It will eventually wear, but with the amount of online shopping my family does we&rsquo;re never lacking fresh cardboard. Though, if the dragging surface were rougher, I&rsquo;d imagine I&rsquo;d have to use a different solution.</p>
<p>Adding useful pieces of equipment to a home gym doesn&rsquo;t have to be expensive or complicated. And, simple additions like this keep workouts engaging and fun.</p>
<p>Benefits of sled training with a tow strap are numerous.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple.</strong> Really hard to mess up.</li>
<li><strong>Cheap.</strong> Just time, a stack of weights, and a ten dollar tow strap is all the investment you need to get started.</li>
<li><strong>Safe.</strong> You can do these by yourself. If you fail, there&rsquo;s nothing that can fall and crush you.</li>
<li><strong>Versatile.</strong> You can do these heavy for strength. You can do these lighter for cardio. You can drag it forward or backward. Or, you can pull it arm-over-arm. Using just a tow strap you have enough equipment for a full body workout.</li>
</ol>
