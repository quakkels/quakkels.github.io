<p>I recently took up hand tool woodworking. I&rsquo;m not good at it. But I&rsquo;m having fun.</p>
<p>These are my favorite resources for learning about it.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="a-bench">A Bench</h2>
<p>As is the case with many beginners; my first woodworking project was my bench. I decided to build a Low Roman Workbench after seeing what <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rOHuC_yuV4">Rex Krueger</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/roman-workbenches-high-low/">Christopher Schwarz</a> had to say about them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hand-tool-woodworking/low-roman-workbench-with-legs.jpg" alt="Adding legs to my bench"></p>
<h2 id="a-shooting-board">A Shooting Board</h2>
<p>The next useful thing that I made was a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.finewoodworking.com/2009/07/07/shooting-board">shooting board</a>, which is a jig used with a hand plane to square the ends of hand cut boards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hand-tool-woodworking/shooting-board.jpg" alt="My shooting board is square"></p>
<p><img src="/images/hand-tool-woodworking/shooting-board-being-used.jpg" alt="My shooting board being used"></p>
<h2 id="winding-sticks">Winding Sticks</h2>
<p>My next project was another tool build. Winding sticks are important to hand tool woodworkers because they help flatten large surfaces, like bench tops, with hand planes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hand-tool-woodworking/winding-sticks-showing-not-flat.jpg" alt="Winding sticks showing how not flat my bench is"></p>
<p>With the aid of the sticks it&rsquo;s really obvious how not-flat my bench is. I was able to plane it down and improve it a lot.</p>
<h2 id="desk-organizer">Desk Organizer</h2>
<p>Around this time I ended up having a need for a cell phone desk stand. I&rsquo;d been doing more mobile development for work, and need to keep multiple phone ready on my desk for testing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hand-tool-woodworking/deskorganizer.jpg" alt="Desk organizer"></p>
<h2 id="the-box">The Box</h2>
<p>After developing some super basic woodworking knowledge, I wanted to tackle a dovetailed box next. But my results were disastrous. I tried again and again, but tail boards and pin boards would never fit. So I decided to take on the less ambitious task of building a box with rabbet joinery instead of dovetails. But even rabbets were harder than I expected and I ended up producing lots of really ugly boards that ended up in the scrap pile.</p>
<p>Eventually I found instructions from Richard Maguire of The English Woodworker. His <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theenglishwoodworker.com/hand-cutting-rebates-back-to-basics-approach-video/">very basic rabbet technique</a> (rebate across the pond) was exactly what I needed to see. He used the simplest of tools that I, as a beginner, actually had access to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hand-tool-woodworking/rabbet-joinery.jpg" alt="Rabbet joinery"></p>
<p>Finally a decently tight joint! This inspired me to attempt cutting dados to fit the box&rsquo;s bottom panel into.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hand-tool-woodworking/dado.jpg" alt="Rabbet joinery"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the completed box:</p>

<h2 id="dovetails">Dovetails</h2>
<p>After all that work making a rabbeted box, I went back and tried a dovetail joint again. This time I had a lot more time working with wood and I was finally able to pull off a joint that, at the very least, fit together:</p>
