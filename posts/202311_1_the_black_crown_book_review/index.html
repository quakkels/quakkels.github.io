<p>The Black Crown is the new debut fantasy novel by <a href="https://www.johnadouglas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John A. Douglas</a>. Douglas is a family man living in Louisiana. He&rsquo;s a huge coffee fan, and a tabletop gamer. He&rsquo;s been writing for years, honing his craft, and this debut novel displays his fantastic storytelling skill.</p>
<p>The Black Crown is a story about a young half orc prince named Ragoth. Raised in royal quarters, but unable to leave, his existence has been kept secret from his people. He&rsquo;s spent his life in isolation for reasons unknown. After a vicious attack on his life, he&rsquo;s forced to embark on a journey across Allspire to claim his birthright.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration of Ragoth. He's the half orc main character of The Black Crown." src="/images/BlackCrownThe_Ragoth_Web.jpg" align="right" />Ragoth becomes a fish-out-of-water; a misplaced prince who must live as a pauper. Prince Ragoth, with his royal education and naivete, is forced from palace life to a life spent in the streets, on the roads, and in the wilderness. While striving to right the wrong against him, Ragoth finds friends, fights foes, and follows a prophecy, wherever it may lead.</p>
<p>Cortland (Cort) is one of the first people to join Ragoth on his journey. He&rsquo;s human with a fiery temper, and a drive for adventure and glory. Though heâ€™s a supporting character, his story grabbed my attention. I really like his character arc. His core personality stays the same, but his goals evolve and mature a lot as the story goes on.</p>
<p>Denith is a humble and slight elf who is the picture of faithfulness to his friends. He sees something in Ragoth that earns Denith&rsquo;s loyalty. Sometimes his loyalty tests the bounds of reason, hinting at hidden motivations.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Val&rsquo;Mora. She&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;The Beast of Barrow&rsquo;s End.&rdquo; Her years of adventuring experience across Allspire made her shrewd. And her size, species, and skill makes her a formidable physical opponent.</p>
<p>Together they fight many dangers and contend with hostile armies, conduct heists, escape foes, and must untangle themselves from a web of secrecy and lies.</p>
<p>John A. Douglas did a great job with this, it&rsquo;s a very impressive debut novel. The world building is fantastic and feels huge. Each new city we encounter has it&rsquo;s own unique feel. And the story is littered with lore and hooks for potential future stories (one in particular I&rsquo;m very eager to find out if it&rsquo;ll get a story.) There&rsquo;s a lot here to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is a good book, and I recommend it. Consider buying it. Douglas does a great job creating a rich world, and captivating characters.</p>
