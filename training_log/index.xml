Warmup  45x10 95x5  Work  135x3 185x3 225x3 245x3 265x3 285x3 PR! Felt too easy 300x3 +25lb PR  18&amp;rdquo; Deadlift Work up to a 5RM over five sets.
 135x5 225x5 315x5 405x5 445x5 +20lb PR  These PRs are really exciting. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how they happened. I don&amp;rsquo;t physically feel super run-down like I usually do when getting PRs.</description>

Warmup  45x10 95x5  Work  135x3 150x3 165x3 175x3 185x3 195x3 200x3 +5 pound PR  Seated Cable Rows Full body &amp;ldquo;cheat&amp;rdquo; rows.
 45x10 90x10 135x10 180x10 225x8  These got really cheaty at the end. Touched the grip to my core everytime, but toward the end it was more of a hip hinge than a cable row.</description>

      <description>Lower Day I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked out for the last few days. So, this week will only have 2 workouts. Today was my lower day, rather than events. I&amp;rsquo;m not too worried about it because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been rotating Farmers and Sandbag the last few weeks.
Paused Front Squats Work up to a 1RM over seven sets. Pause in hole for one second.
Warmup  45x10 95x5  Work  135x1 185x1 225x1 245x1 265x1 295x1 315x1 PR  Your browser does not support the video tag.</description>

      <description>Upper Day Inclined Paused Close Grip Bench Work up to a 1RM over seven sets. Pause one second at the bottom.
Warmup  45x10 95x5  Work  135x1 155x1 165x1 175x1 190x1 200x1 215x0 Failed the rep 210x1 PR  I was pretty certain I had that 215 pounds in me. But it stalled right at my forehead. I decided to backoff and go for 210. I got that and it&amp;rsquo;s still a PR by 5 pounds.</description>

      <description>Sandbag and Farmers Day Farmers Walk Lap is 40ft with turn then a drop. Final set finish with hold ALAP.
 100x4 160x2 200x1, held for 8 breaths PR  The hold for as long as possible after the last set is great for mindset. Knowing I could have carried it farther carries positivity over to the next workout.
Sandbag Load Max loads in one minute.
Warmup  5x85  Work  235x1 PR  So this isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what Mike&amp;rsquo;s program calls for, but I decided it would be fun to change it up.</description>

      <description>Lower Day Squats Pause at the bottom for one second. Work up to a 1RM over seven sets.
Warmup  135x10 185x5  Work  225x1 275x1 315x1 345x1 365x1 375x1 385x1  385lbs for one is certainly a paused PR. But, I think I could have gone heavier. It was right around 9 or 9.5 RPE. Given my recent track record of failing top sets it&amp;rsquo;s probably better that I didn&amp;rsquo;t make a heavier attempt.</description>

      <description>Upper Day Close Grip Bench Press Work up to 1RM over seven sets. Pause at the bottom for one second.
 45x10 95x5   185x1 195x1 205x1 215x1 225x1 235x1 245x1 (Pretty sure this is a PR)  245x1 definitely felt like a true 1RM. I changed my approach to these seven sets compared to last time. The warmups that I had been including are now separate sets so that the seven can be closer jumps.</description>

 100x4 (lowered starting wait compared to last time.) 160x2 195x1 PR  Sandbag Load This was planned to be a seated row day. But, since last week&amp;rsquo;s sandbag went so poorly I decided to revisit the sandbag today.

 135x10 185x5 225x2 275x2 315x2 345x2 365x2 This might&amp;rsquo;ve been an RPE8.5.  2&amp;rdquo; Deficit Deadlift Decided not to do touch&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;go reps this week because I use bumpers and deficit deads are a pretty new movement pattern for me. Work up to a 3RM over 5 sets.

      <description>No Plan Day Since I&amp;rsquo;m certainly going to change my program starting next week, I decide to stray from the HLM template that I&amp;rsquo;ve been following.
Today I focused on Farmer Walks and Cable rows. I spent some time rigging up a couple of pulleys to add to my Spud Inc pulley. So now I have a pulldown that is straight vertical, and I can rig it so I have a seated cable row as well.</description>

      <description>Heavy Day Squats are increasing slowly. Overhead press is increasing slowly. But deadlifts have regressed. I think one heavy set a week and one workout of SLDL 3x5 a week isn&amp;rsquo;t working. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if doing heavy squats in the same workout as heavy deadlifts is too taxing.
I might decide to go back a to 4 day split next week.

      <description>Heavy Day Skipped over the medium day and went straight to heavy. Redoing the squat session from my last heavy workout to get all 3x5 at 335lbs.
Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x3 335 for 3 sets of 5  Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 155x1 162.5lbs for 5 sets of 3  My arms felt dead today. I could only manage 3 reps in the first set. So I switched to 5x3 instead of 3x5.</description>

      <description>Heavy Day I didn&amp;rsquo;t train much during December. So this workout is a measure of how much I&amp;rsquo;ve regressed.
Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x5 335x5 335x5 335x4  Only had 4 reps in my last set. But I&amp;rsquo;m pleased I was able to do this with 335.
Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 145x1 155x1 160 for 3 sets of 5  Very pleased that I was able to get these reps with 160 pounds.</description>

      <description> Heavy Day Weights felt good today. Feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve accidentally timed my first workout back after Thanksgiving so that everything felt great.
Also, my shoulder didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me at all today. It&amp;rsquo;ll be tested in a couple days with bench.

The higher reps, closer grip, and pause made me feel like I was working at least a little bit. Didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go any heavier because I could definitely &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; the weight on my shoulder.

      <description>Today I started a new approach with Heavy/Light/Medium (HLM.)
Heavy Day Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x3 325x1 340lbs for 3 sets of 5  Squats were prescribed to be 5x5, but I changed it once the workout was underway because it was taking so long, and it felt heavy.
Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 155x1 157.5lbs for 3 sets of 5  Press was prescribed for 5x5. Decided to change it to 3x5 just like squat.</description>

Unfortunately, I failed with 495lbs. It broke off the blocks, but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it past my knees.
Might attempt 485 tomorrow or Sunday.</description>

      <description>Deadlift Day Yay! Day two back on track.
Superset 1 Goal was to deadlift 405 for 5 sets of 3. But failed the third rep of the second set and had to back off a bit.
Deadlift: 3 at 405lbs, then 2 at 405lbs. Finished with 3 sets of 3 at 395lbs.

      <description>Overhead Press Day Getting back into the routine this week. Last week amounted to a full 7 days away from the gym. I was starting to feel a little run down anyway. The weights were feeling heavier than they should. So maybe the week off will do some good for my recovery.

      <description>Bench Day Conflicts in my schedule have caused me to miss a few days this week. I decided to skip ahead to bench day and modify it pretty heavily from what I usually do.
Bench: 230lbs 5x3
Barbell Row: 225lbs for 3. Then 245lbs for 2x3 (PR)
I am happy with the rowing. For the last several weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve used an axle bar. With an axle I end up being limited by grip.</description>

      <description> Overhead Press Day Switching it up! Changing up the Persistence program from the first time I ran it. Instead of an upper and lower superset each day, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have an upper body day with two upper body supersets. Lower body days will have two lower body supersets. This hopefully will be easier to recover from.
