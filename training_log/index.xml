      <description>Heavy Day Skipped over the medium day and went straight to heavy. Redoing the squat session from my last heavy workout to get all 3x5 at 335lbs.
Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x3 335 for 3 sets of 5  Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 155x1 162.5lbs for 5 sets of 3  My arms felt dead today. I could only manage 3 reps in the first set. So I switched to 5x3 instead of 3x5.</description>

      <description>Heavy Day I didn&amp;rsquo;t train much during December. So this workout is a measure of how much I&amp;rsquo;ve regressed.
Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x5 335x5 335x5 335x4  Only had 4 reps in my last set. But I&amp;rsquo;m pleased I was able to do this with 335.
Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 145x1 155x1 160 for 3 sets of 5  Very pleased that I was able to get these reps with 160 pounds.</description>

      <description> Heavy Day Weights felt good today. Feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve accidentally timed my first workout back after Thanksgiving so that everything felt great.
Also, my shoulder didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me at all today. It&amp;rsquo;ll be tested in a couple days with bench.
Squats  45x5 135x5 225x3 315x3 335x1 345lbs for 3 sets of 5  Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 150x1 160lbs for 3 sets of 5  Deadlift  225x5 315x3 365x1 405lbs for 1 set of 5  </description>

The higher reps, closer grip, and pause made me feel like I was working at least a little bit. Didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go any heavier because I could definitely &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; the weight on my shoulder.

      <description>Today I started a new approach with Heavy/Light/Medium (HLM.)
Heavy Day Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x3 325x1 340lbs for 3 sets of 5  Squats were prescribed to be 5x5, but I changed it once the workout was underway because it was taking so long, and it felt heavy.
Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 155x1 157.5lbs for 3 sets of 5  Press was prescribed for 5x5. Decided to change it to 3x5 just like squat.</description>

Unfortunately, I failed with 495lbs. It broke off the blocks, but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it past my knees.
Might attempt 485 tomorrow or Sunday.</description>

      <description>Deadlift Day Yay! Day two back on track.
Superset 1 Goal was to deadlift 405 for 5 sets of 3. But failed the third rep of the second set and had to back off a bit.
Deadlift: 3 at 405lbs, then 2 at 405lbs. Finished with 3 sets of 3 at 395lbs.
Superset with&amp;hellip;
Ab Roller 5 sets of 10 with bodyweight.
Superset 2    Lift LBs Sets Reps     SSB Squat 295 4 3   DB Step Up 40 4 6    The program is getting heavy enough that I&amp;rsquo;m removing some of the supplemental work like the Pinch Block and Jumping Jacks.</description>

      <description>Overhead Press Day Getting back into the routine this week. Last week amounted to a full 7 days away from the gym. I was starting to feel a little run down anyway. The weights were feeling heavier than they should. So maybe the week off will do some good for my recovery.

      <description>Bench Day Conflicts in my schedule have caused me to miss a few days this week. I decided to skip ahead to bench day and modify it pretty heavily from what I usually do.
Bench: 230lbs 5x3
Barbell Row: 225lbs for 3. Then 245lbs for 2x3 (PR)
I am happy with the rowing. For the last several weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve used an axle bar. With an axle I end up being limited by grip.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m going to watch my protein intake to see if I can continue this block&amp;rsquo;s linear progression. Though, I might reduce reps down to 2 instead of 3. Or, I might only train deadlifts once every two weeks.</description>

      <description> Overhead Press Day Switching it up! Changing up the Persistence program from the first time I ran it. Instead of an upper and lower superset each day, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have an upper body day with two upper body supersets. Lower body days will have two lower body supersets. This hopefully will be easier to recover from.

      <description>Overhead Press Day Decided to switch up the set and rep scheme just a little. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a calorie deficit for about a week, and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to keep up with my lifts if I reduce the reps per set, but then increase total sets.
