      <description>Event Day Yoke Run I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to work up to 70% from last time, but that was a bad workout for me. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to guess at a reasonable number and work up to 345lbs.
 175x50&amp;rsquo; 265x50&amp;rsquo; 315x50&amp;rsquo; 345x50&amp;rsquo; 345x50&amp;rsquo; 345x50&amp;rsquo;  By the last run that 345 felt just about right.
Sandbag Load Use the same sandbag as last time. Two loads for a five minute EMOM.</description>

      <description>Lower Day I&amp;rsquo;m trying two new things this workout. One, I&amp;rsquo;m eating two pieces of toast with honey. The first before the workout starts, and the second after squats are done. Two, I&amp;rsquo;m using knee sleeves for the first time today. My squat PR is 420 pounds without sleeves, so I think I&amp;rsquo;m strong enough that I can justify using them. Also, they&amp;rsquo;ll be useful for more knee stability during moving events like sled, farmers, and yoke.</description>

 135x3 155x3 160x3 felt good 165x 170x3  170 for three reps is not a PR but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve trained strict barbell overhead press. I probably could&amp;rsquo;ve gone 5 pounds heavier which would&amp;rsquo;ve tied my last 3RM.</description>

      <description>Yoke Day Yoke Work up to a top run of 50&amp;rsquo; over five sets. Nothing crazy heavy. Should slow me down. Should not get me staggering.
Yoke runs were essentially superset with light power stairs and duck walk. Between runs I keep having to grab more plates from the basement and take them outside.

      <description>Yoke and Sled Day Day 3 is such a mess. I tried sticking with the spirit of day 3 (moving and strongman events) but I did not have the correct mindset from the beginning and I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked it so much that it hardly looks like what the program has written. Since there are only two more &amp;ldquo;day threes&amp;rdquo; left, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to continue trying to stay with the spirit of day 3 rather than doing the workouts exactly as written.</description>

Yoke Progressively heavier runs of 50ft over five sets. Work up to a challenging weight that&amp;rsquo;s still manageable. Heavy enough to slow me, but not heavy enough to barely be able to walk.</description>

      <description>Farmers and Sandbag Load Sled Drag Day I haven&amp;rsquo;t been rotating day 3 like the Basic Strongman program prescribes. The last two weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little burned out on this day, so I&amp;rsquo;ve skipped them. I think not rotating was a mistake. I bet the variety would have helped to avoid the mental burnout. So, week 8 day 3 has farmers and tire flips prescribed. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a tire, but I do have a little DIY sled drag thingy I can rig up.</description>

      <description>No Plan Day Since I&amp;rsquo;m certainly going to change my program starting next week, I decide to stray from the HLM template that I&amp;rsquo;ve been following.
Today I focused on Farmer Walks and Cable rows. I spent some time rigging up a couple of pulleys to add to my Spud Inc pulley. So now I have a pulldown that is straight vertical, and I can rig it so I have a seated cable row as well.</description>

      <description>Heavy Day Squats are increasing slowly. Overhead press is increasing slowly. But deadlifts have regressed. I think one heavy set a week and one workout of SLDL 3x5 a week isn&amp;rsquo;t working. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if doing heavy squats in the same workout as heavy deadlifts is too taxing.
I might decide to go back a to 4 day split next week.

      <description>Heavy Day Skipped over the medium day and went straight to heavy. Redoing the squat session from my last heavy workout to get all 3x5 at 335lbs.
Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x3 335 for 3 sets of 5  Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 155x1 162.5lbs for 5 sets of 3  My arms felt dead today. I could only manage 3 reps in the first set. So I switched to 5x3 instead of 3x5.</description>

      <description>Heavy Day I didn&amp;rsquo;t train much during December. So this workout is a measure of how much I&amp;rsquo;ve regressed.
Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x5 335x5 335x5 335x4  Only had 4 reps in my last set. But I&amp;rsquo;m pleased I was able to do this with 335.
Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 145x1 155x1 160 for 3 sets of 5  Very pleased that I was able to get these reps with 160 pounds.</description>

      <description>Heavy Day Weights felt good today. Feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve accidentally timed my first workout back after Thanksgiving so that everything felt great.
Also, my shoulder didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me at all today. It&amp;rsquo;ll be tested in a couple days with bench.

The higher reps, closer grip, and pause made me feel like I was working at least a little bit. Didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go any heavier because I could definitely &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; the weight on my shoulder.

Heavy Day Squats  45x5 135x5 225x5 315x3 325x1 340lbs for 3 sets of 5  Squats were prescribed to be 5x5, but I changed it once the workout was underway because it was taking so long, and it felt heavy.
Overhead Press  45x5 95x5 135x3 155x1 157.5lbs for 3 sets of 5  Press was prescribed for 5x5. Decided to change it to 3x5 just like squat.</description>

      <description>Overhead Press Day Getting back into the routine this week. Last week amounted to a full 7 days away from the gym. I was starting to feel a little run down anyway. The weights were feeling heavier than they should. So maybe the week off will do some good for my recovery.

      <description>Bench Day Conflicts in my schedule have caused me to miss a few days this week. I decided to skip ahead to bench day and modify it pretty heavily from what I usually do.
Bench: 230lbs 5x3
Barbell Row: 225lbs for 3. Then 245lbs for 2x3 (PR)
I am happy with the rowing. For the last several weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve used an axle bar. With an axle I end up being limited by grip.</description>

      <description>Deadlift Day Superset 1    Lift LBs Sets Reps     Deadlift 385 5 3   Ab Roller bw 5 10   Jumping Jacks bw 5 20    These deadlifts felt very heavy. I&amp;rsquo;m going to watch my protein intake to see if I can continue this block&amp;rsquo;s linear progression. Though, I might reduce reps down to 2 instead of 3. Or, I might only train deadlifts once every two weeks.</description>

      <description>Overhead Press Day Switching it up! Changing up the Persistence program from the first time I ran it. Instead of an upper and lower superset each day, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have an upper body day with two upper body supersets. Lower body days will have two lower body supersets. This hopefully will be easier to recover from.

      <description>Overhead Press Day Decided to switch up the set and rep scheme just a little. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a calorie deficit for about a week, and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to keep up with my lifts if I reduce the reps per set, but then increase total sets.
