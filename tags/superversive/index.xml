      <description>According to the science fiction author John C. Wright, the term &amp;ldquo;superversive&amp;rdquo; was first coined by Tom Simon. The first mention of superversive that I could find on Simon&amp;rsquo;s blog was from all the way back in 2003. Then, in 2014, the word was used in the title of The Superversive Literary Movement.
Tom Simon, and others in the movement, recognized that fiction and storytelling has been increasingly used as propaganda to undermine virtue and traditional values.</description>
