      <description>This is the beginning of an original short story thriller about a man who must defend his family and home from a bloodthirsty monster.
Thank you to my Beta Readers: Ben, Dad, Jesse, and Kyle.
 Malice at Midnight By: Brandon Quakkelaar
I woke because of the snarling. The bed shuddered as our dog leapt out and tore from the room. Her claws skated on the hardwood as she accelerated. Sixty pounds of Golden Labrador barely made the corner.</description>

      <description>John Bunyan&amp;rsquo;s classic, The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress, is a book that deserves a permanent place on your bookshelf. It&amp;rsquo;s right up there with The Hobbit, and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Every time I read it, I&amp;rsquo;m struck by a new part of the story. The re-readability factor is high.
The last time I read The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress, I was inspired by Christian&amp;rsquo;s courage in the face of evil. This time, I am struck by how Christian&amp;rsquo;s hope kept him from succumbing to despair.</description>

      <description>According to the science fiction author John C. Wright, the term &amp;ldquo;superversive&amp;rdquo; was first coined by Tom Simon. The first mention of superversive that I could find on Simon&amp;rsquo;s blog was from all the way back in 2003. Then, in 2014, the word was used in the title of The Superversive Literary Movement.
Tom Simon, and others in the movement, recognized that fiction and storytelling has been increasingly used as propaganda to undermine virtue and traditional values.</description>
