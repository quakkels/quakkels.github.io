      <description>I bought my first deer rifle in 2021. Friends recommended I try Savage, and I found one. It was a Savage Axis in 30-06 for right around $350 bucks at Cabela&amp;rsquo;s.

Unfortunately, that lucky feeling was shortly followed by astonishment when I saw all the .308 on the shelves, with nary a box of 30-06 anywhere.</description>
