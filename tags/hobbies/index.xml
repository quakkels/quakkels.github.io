      <description>Lackluster and lame excuses for entertainment have been piling up over the last few years, and Hollywood has lost its shine. What&amp;rsquo;s left is a grating subversion of my culture. It&amp;rsquo;s to the point that I tend to ignore new releases unless they&amp;rsquo;re recommended by people I trust. When big studios announce that they&amp;rsquo;ve acquired a beloved IP, or are remaking a classic story, there&amp;rsquo;s no excitement left. There&amp;rsquo;s no anticipation other than dread for whatever flop they&amp;rsquo;ll end up delivering.</description>

      <description>I bought my first deer rifle in 2021. Friends recommended I try Savage, and I found one. It was a Savage Axis in 30-06 for right around $350 bucks at Cabela&amp;rsquo;s. I felt so lucky because, if you remember, guns were in high demand in 2021. Unfortunately, that lucky feeling was shortly followed by astonishment when I saw all the .308 on the shelves, with nary a box of 30-06 anywhere.</description>

      <description>I recently took up hand tool woodworking. I&amp;rsquo;m not good at it. But I&amp;rsquo;m having fun.
These are my favorite resources for learning about it.
 The English Woodworker Rex Krueger Wood By Wright  A Bench As is the case with many beginners; my first woodworking project was my bench. I decided to build a Low Roman Workbench after seeing what Rex Krueger and Christopher Schwarz had to say about them.</description>

      <title>Program Review: Mike Westerling&#39;s Basic Strongman</title>

      <description>This is my review of Basic Strongman. Basic Strongman is a program by Mike Westerling that I spent the last 12 weeks running. It&amp;rsquo;s a 3-day-a-week program for general strength and the sport of Strongman.
My Lifting History First a little about me to give you some context for this review. I&amp;rsquo;m 35 and not particularly athletic. Four years ago I started taking strength training seriously. I had gone to commercial gyms off and on for a couple years before building a home gym.</description>

      <title>Home Gym Outfitting; Train with a Sled</title>

      <description>Outfitting a home gym with a sled for drags and arm-over-arm pulls is simple. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment or gym memberships in order to train with a sled. You also don&amp;rsquo;t really need any tools or handyman skills to get started.
When I first wanted to add arm-over-arm pulls to work my cardio, grip, arms, and back, I looked around and found a few different options.</description>

      <title>Why I Prioritize Strength Training</title>

      <description>Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken up a new hobby; strength training. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve really grown to love. Though, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to articulate exactly why strength training has taken such a permanent position in my weekly routine.
When I was a sedentary person my quality of life decreased every year. Even when I was in my mid 20s I was not &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and frequent back and shoulder pain would frustrate me for weeks at a time.</description>

      <title>Into the Nether: Linux</title>

      <description>The first movie I saw that really got me excited about computers was WarGames. The WOPR was an inanimate object that just sat there on screen. But, it was still a complete character all by itself. It reacted to the Matthew Broderick character&amp;rsquo;s commands and questions and became something more clever than just a boring piece of hardware. The fictional software running inside the WOPR and Broderick&amp;rsquo;s character&amp;rsquo;s ability to interface with it created a story that was incredibly mystical and exciting.</description>
