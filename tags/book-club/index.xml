      <description>Lackluster and lame excuses for entertainment have been piling up over the last few years, and Hollywood has lost its shine. What&amp;rsquo;s left is a grating subversion of my culture. It&amp;rsquo;s to the point that I tend to ignore new releases unless they&amp;rsquo;re recommended by people I trust. When big studios announce that they&amp;rsquo;ve acquired a beloved IP, or are remaking a classic story, there&amp;rsquo;s no excitement left. There&amp;rsquo;s no anticipation other than dread for whatever flop they&amp;rsquo;ll end up delivering.</description>

      <description>This is the beginning of an original short story thriller about a man who must defend his family and home from a bloodthirsty monster.

Malice at Midnight, Synopsis It&amp;rsquo;s the dead of night, and something is clearly wrong. The family dog raises the alarm, and wakes the house.

      <description>John Bunyan&amp;rsquo;s classic, The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress, is a book that deserves a permanent place on your bookshelf. It&amp;rsquo;s right up there with The Hobbit, and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Every time I read it, I&amp;rsquo;m struck by a new part of the story. The re-readability factor is high.
The last time I read The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress, I was inspired by Christian&amp;rsquo;s courage in the face of evil. This time, I am struck by how Christian&amp;rsquo;s hope kept him from succumbing to despair.</description>

      <title>The Fairy Tale Horror, Little Red Riding Hood</title>

      <description>When I decided to analyze Little Red Riding Hood, I was not expecting to find a story that bludgeoned the reader (or listener) over the head with a spiked bat. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what this version of the story does. It&amp;rsquo;s a full fledged horror story that has a moral for the kids, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a moral for the adults reading it.
The version of Little Red Riding Hood featured in the Junior Classics Fairy and Wonder Tales (published in 1918) was originally written down by Charles Perrault in the seventeenth century, though people point out that he&amp;rsquo;s probably not the source of the original idea.</description>

      <title>The Fairy Tale of Hansel and Grethel</title>

      <description>Hansel and Grethel is the story about two siblings who survive being abandoned by their guardians, they escape capture by a witch, and they reunite with their father as a happy family in the end. There are many different versions of the story, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on the story by The Brothers Grimm.
I got my hands on a version that was published in 1918 in an anthology series called Junior Classics.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how old I was when I first read an abridged version of John Bunyan&amp;rsquo;s Christian allegory, The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book, and the abridged version (which I&amp;rsquo;ve unfortunately misplaced at some point) had great illustrations and was very approachable when I was a boy.
John Bunyan lived in England during the 17th century. He witnessed civil war, plague, and he experienced religious persecution. He wrote the first part of The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress while in prison for not following the Church of England.</description>
