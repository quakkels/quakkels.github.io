      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how old I was when I first read an abridged version of John Bunyan&amp;rsquo;s Christian allegory, The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book, and the abridged version (which I&amp;rsquo;ve unfortunately misplaced at some point) had great illustrations and was very approachable when I was a boy.
John Bunyan lived in England during the 17th century. He witnessed civil war, plague, and he experienced religious persecution. He wrote the first part of The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress while in prison for not following the Church of England.</description>

      <description>I wrote the first draft of this article all the way back in February of 2019. This started as a quick guide for how to build good habits using principles from physical training. But it quickly grew when I wanted to explore how to identify good character and good virtue. Back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how big this topic is and how many different ways of answering it there are. So, I continued exploring the topic, and enjoying the underlying philosophy.</description>
